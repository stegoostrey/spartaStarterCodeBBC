Feature: Basic selenium tests on the BBC website
  As a user of cucumber
  I want to gain a better understanding of feature files and selenium
  So I can build my own automated test scripts

  Scenario: A user can access the home page and click the sign in link
    Given I can access the bbc home page
    When I click the sign in link
    Then I should access the sign in page

  Scenario: I can input name and password details that receives an error for lack of letters
    Given I am on the Sign-In page
    When I input username "Dave@mail.com"
    And I input password "abcd"
    Then I receive an error of "xyz"
